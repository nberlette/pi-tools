# Overclocking

## Raspberry Pi 400

The Pi 400 already runs at a factory 1.8 GHz, which is significantly faster than the 1.5 GHz of the 4B.
We can take it a step further, however, and clock speeds of 2 GHz without any throttling. This is 
primarily thanks to the Pi 400's massive internal heatsink, which works quite well.

Get started by adding **one** of these to your `/boot/config.txt` file.

> Running Ubuntu on your Pi? Check `/system-boot/config.txt` instead.

### First Timer: 1.9 GHz

```ini
arm_freq=1900
over_voltage=4
```

### Recommended: 2.0 GHz

```ini
arm_freq=2000
over_voltage=5
```

### Performance: 2.1 GHz

```ini
arm_freq=2100
over_voltage=6
```

### Danger Zone: 2.2 GHz

```ini
arm_freq=2200
over_voltage=8
force_turbo=1
```

> **Warning**: the `force_turbo` bit _will_ void your warranty!

## Raspberry Pi 4B

Since the 4B runs at 1.5 GHz, it's wise to start around 1.8 GHz, instead of 2+ GHz right out the door.
Active cooling is a *mandatory* requirement for overclocking the 4B. You will experience throttling 
almost immediately without adequate cooling.

```ini
arm_freq=1800
over_voltage=4
```
